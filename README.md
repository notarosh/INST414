# Data Science Projects

This repository showcases projects from data science courses at the University of Maryland, along with some personal projects. Each project applies core concepts such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and regression modeling using real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Sleep Health & Lifestyle Clustering
- **Notebook:** `sleep_health_clustering.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`
- **Summary:** Applied K-means clustering to explore patterns in sleep behavior and lifestyle factors. Identified groups based on sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, and BMI.
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, normalization, silhouette scoring, K-means clustering, data visualization.

### 2. Life Expectancy Regression Analysis
- **Notebook:** `life_expectancy_regression_analysis.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `Life-Expectancy-Data-Averaged.csv`
- **Summary:** Investigated global life expectancy trends using regression analysis. Explored relationships between GDP, healthcare, education, and longevity.
- **Techniques:** Data wrangling, correlation heatmaps, regression modeling, bootstrapping, and visualization with ggplot2.

### 3. Spotify Artist Clustering
- **Notebook:** `spotify_artist_clustering.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `nodes.csv`, `edges.csv`
- **Summary:** Applied K-means clustering to explore patterns in Spotify artists. Identified groups based on song genre.
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, normalization, silhouette scoring, K-means clustering, data visualization.

### 4. Life Expectancy Predictive Model
- **Notebook:** `life_expectancy_predictive_model.ipynb`
- **Dataset:** `Life-Expectancy-Data-Averaged.csv`
- **Summary:** Built a predictive model to estimate life expectancy using multiple regression and feature selection. Evaluated model performance using RMSE and residual analysis.
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, multivariate regression, model evaluation, feature selection, error analysis.
